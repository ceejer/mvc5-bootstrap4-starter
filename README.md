## Routing
This template uses one controller (Home) and modifies the routes such that only the method action shown in the url.
exp: baseUrl/{action}/{id}

If a site needs more routing capabilty you'll need to change back to the default MVC routing and add more controllers.

This template is setup to use bootstrap4 with Sass!  

Sass compilation is being done with a Visual Studio Extension.  You'll need to install this extension.
